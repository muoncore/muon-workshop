# MuonJS

MuonJS takes Muon-node and runs it through a transpiler to be able to run within a browser environment. Then, the transport and discovery are replaced with a dedicated websocket connection to the server side MuonJS Gateway. The Gateway gives the browsers visibility of server side services and acts as a message channel router, enabling Muon clients in the browser to open bi directional channels to the back end services via the gateway.

This is highly experimental, and not production ready. The workshop is currently outdated.
